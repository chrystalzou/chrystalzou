Hi there 👋 You've probably arrived at this page because we may work together at some point! This is a brief readme mostly for coworkers on how to make the most of our collaboration ✨ 

### 👩🏻‍💻 Currently
- Credit Builder at Chime

### 🌎 Previously
- Data Stream Processor at Splunk
- Growth & Analytics in China at Booking.com

### 📈 Motivations
- Understanding how my work translates into business or customer impact
- Agency and ownership in decision-making
- Helping others succeed through advocacy, feedback, and collaboration
- Learning opportunities (new technologies, perspectives, domains)

### 📉 Demotivations
- Overengineered processes to get things done
- Lack of empathy or psychological safety
- Being evaluated on vanity metrics e.g. hours worked, tickets completed

### Availability / Communication
- I feel irrationally anxious when DMed with "hello, how are you?" without a followup. nohello.com is a great read.
- I prefer meetings in the afternoon, and back-to-back rather than spread out in a day
- I am generally online 10AM-6PM M-F, Pacific time. I try not to work odd hours often.
- My Slack is almost always on DND so I can focus, but if something is urgent, please feel free to override DND to get my attention!
- I like meeting peers outside of my immediate team. Please feel free to drop a 1:1 on my calendar anytime :) I like learning about what you're working on, where we might intersect, and how I can help. I am also always down to talk shop about powerlifting, food, and travel.
- If you are a manager, please gives me a heads-up about what you'd like to discuss so I'm not nervous.

### Feedback
- Positive feedback: Slack and letting me manager know I did a good things are both great!
- Constructive: In-person is best. Zoom is next-best. Slack is better than nothing at all. It's really helpful if specific examples can be included, so I know what to improve on. Thank you for giving me feedback, no matter how minor - I genuinely want to be better :)
